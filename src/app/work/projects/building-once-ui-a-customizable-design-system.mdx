- **Backend**: Node.js + Express.js for server management and game coordination
- **Real-time Communication**: Socket.IO over WebSocket for instant move synchronization

### Key Features
- FEN-optimized game state representation
- Client-to-client bound multiplayer synchronization
- Accurate chess rule validation via chess.js
- Real-time move broadcasting
